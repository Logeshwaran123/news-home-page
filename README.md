This page was developed using HTML, CSS and JAVA SCRIPT

## SECTIONS - Page

## Project Description

In this project I learned on some important things like Grid and Flex Box management in every instance of the code. This made me patient enough to build the responsive designusing HTML and CSS.

## Navigation section

Mobile view of Navigation is simply made by a solution of my own to modify directly the elements of the page on listening to a click event.

## Main Section

Made of various grid and flex box layouts and applied various kinds of postion properties using my solidfied skills of internet and things are made to be used during the process.

## Footer Section

Since the footer section can be made use of the container blocks with the grid container elements, also the elements are arranged in a footer section element.

## üöê Take aways

- Using Grid and Flex Box and Managing the Section
- Contents made to be more wrapped into the screen on every instances of the codebase.
- Things made clearer in the making of this process are analysing a layout or design on both mobile and desktop design simultaneously.
- Making codebase clearer and readable as much as possible in the time of writing the solution for the design is something annoying but I worked with a keymap on the basis of TODO list.
